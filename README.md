## Introduction
Welcome to my Digital Portfolio Website! This website is a showcase of my skills and projects. It's built using the Next.js framework and styled with Tailwind CSS. The website is still under development and I'm excited to connect with you through my socials, which you can find in the introduction section of the website.

## Technologies Used
This project was created with:
* React
* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS

## Website Structure
Here's an overview of the files and directories in the website:

- `page.tsx`: The main landing page of the portfolio.
- `./skills`: A page dedicated to showcasing my skills.
- `/.projects`: A directory containing pages for each of my projects.
- `layouts.tsx`: A page containing the layout for the entire website.
- `globals.css`: A file containing all the global styling for the website.

## Usage
To connect with me, simply click on the social media icons in the introduction section. Also, don't forget to scroll until the end of the website to explore all the content.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout the development of this portfolio, I learned how to effectively use Next.js for building a dynamic website and how to style it using Tailwind CSS. I also learned how to structure a project for easy navigation and future scalability.

## Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to add more interactive elements to the website to make it more engaging. I also plan to include a blog section where I can share my thoughts and experiences on various topics.
